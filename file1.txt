First you need to find out where is your Bash interpreter located. Enter the following into your command line
$ which bash
/bin/bash

The next thing you need to do is open our favorite text editor and create a file called hello_world.sh. We will use nano for this step.
$ nano hello_world.sh

Copy and paste the following lines into the new file and save it:
#!/bin/bash
# declare STRING variable
STRING="Hello World"
# print variable on a screen
echo $STRING

Navigate to the directory where your hello_world.sh bash script is located and make the file executable:
$ chmod +x hello_world.sh 

Now you are ready to execute your first bash script:
$ ./hello_world.sh 


docker exec -it 4486435512ad mysql -u root -p 
use db_ktx
show tables;
select * from student;

 echo "root" | docker secret create db_username -
echo "root" | docker secret create db_password - 

docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml quan-ly-ktx

docker swarm leave --force
